## OpenSDP Data Janitor Tutorial (R)
## Combining Files in R: Building an Analysis File

In this tutorial, you will learn R commands for combining cleaned data
files to make an analysis file. This tutorial assumes that you have a limited
knowledge of R. If you donâ€™t know any R at all, you may find it helpful
to complete the OpenSDP Data Exploration Tutorial before starting this one.

In Part 1, you will briefly inspect cleaned student, test score, and
school data files. In Part 2, you will combine the student and test score files;
in Part 3, you will add information about schools; and in Part 4 you
will define several derived variables.

To run this tutorial you will need R Studio version 1.0 or higher.
Download the R .zip file and unzip the contents into a folder on your Desktop.
Double-click to open the data_exploration_tutorial.Rmd file in the folder
using R Studio. In the file viewer pane, you'll see a set of commands with
a grey background. Click on the small green triangle on the right margin of
line 13 to run the commands. Then, scroll down to read through the content
in the file viewer pane (this is the tutorial). As you see each grey
section of code, click on the green arrow to run the commands. You will
see the results in the window below. Use the results to answer the
questions in the tutorial. Check your answers with the answer key.
